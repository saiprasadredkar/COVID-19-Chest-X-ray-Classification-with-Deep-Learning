# 🩺 COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification with Deep Learning
This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images and predict potential COVID-19 infections.

# 🔬 Overview
Used TensorFlow/Keras for model development

Data preprocessing with ImageDataGenerator

Evaluated on training & validation sets with confusion matrix and classification report

Achieved ~90% validation accuracy with low loss

# 📁 Project Structure
covid19xrayprediction.ipynb – Main notebook

Trained CNN model with accuracy tracking

Evaluation: Confusion matrix + classification report

Visualizations for loss/accuracy across epochs

# 🔍 Tools & Libraries
TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

scikit-learn for evaluation metrics

# 📊 Results
Training accuracy: 99%

Validation accuracy: ~90%

Clear classification breakdown via confusion matrix

# 📎 Future Improvements
